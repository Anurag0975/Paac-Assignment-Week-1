# PaAC Week 1 – Quantum State Tomography Project

This repository contains the Week 1 assignment for the PAAC program.
The project demonstrates single-qubit quantum state tomography using
Pauli-basis measurements on simulated data.

## Project Overview
The notebook generates synthetic measurement outcomes for known quantum states,
reconstructs the corresponding density matrices, and validates the results
using standard physical consistency checks.

## Repository Structure
- `PAAC_assignment_week1.ipynb`: Complete implementation of the assignment
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries
- `measurement_theory_notes.md`: Summary of measurement theory and assumptions
- `technical_writeup.md`: Technical explanation and reflection
- `source_assets.md`: Description of datasets, notebook, and assets used
- `qst_data/`: Measurement data and metadata files
- `single_qubit/`: Reconstructed states and validation summaries
- `density_matrix_htmls/`: HTML-based visualizations of density matrices

## Execution
The project can be run by installing the dependencies listed in
`requirements.txt` and executing the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
